<p class="cap">"What do you call it?" the buyer asked Jenkins.</p>

<p>"I named it 'Journey Home' but you can think
up a better name for it if you want. I'll guarantee that
it sells, though. There's nothing like it on any midway."</p>

<p>"I'd like to try it out first, of course," Allenby said.
"Star-Time uses only the very best, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," Jenkins said. He had heard the line
before, from almost every carnival buyer to whom he
had sold. He did not do much business with the carnivals;
there weren't enough to keep him busy with large
or worthwhile rides and features. The amusement parks
of the big cities were usually the best markets.</p>

<p>Allenby warily eyed the entrance, a room fashioned
from a side-show booth. A rough red curtain concealed
the inside. Over the doorway, in crude dark blue paint,
was lettered, "Journey Home." Behind the doorway was
a large barnlike structure, newly painted white, where
Jenkins did his planning, his building, and his finishing.
When he sold a new ride it was either transported from
inside the building through the large, pull-away doors in
back or taken apart piece by piece and shipped to the
park or carny that bought it.</p>

<p>"Six thousand's a lot of money," the buyer said.</p>

<p>"Just try it," Jenkins told him.</p>

<p>The buyer shrugged. "O.K.," he said. "Let's go in."
They walked through the red curtain. Inside the booth-entrance
was a soft-cushioned easy-chair, also red, secured
firmly in place. It was a piece of salvage from a
two-engine commercial airplane. A helmet looking like a
Flash Gordon accessory-hair drier combination was set
over it. Jenkins flipped a switch and the room became
bright with light. "I thought you said this wasn't a thrill
ride," Allenby said, looking at the helmetlike structure
ominously hanging over the chair.</p>

<p>"It isn't," Jenkins said, smiling. "Sit down." He strapped
the buyer into place in the chair.</p>

<p>"Hey, wait a minute," Allenby protested. "Why the
straps?"</p>

<p>"Leave everything to me and don't worry," Jenkins
said, fitting the headgear into place over the buyer's head.
The back of it fitted easily over the entire rear of the
skull, down to his neck. The front came just below the
eyes. After turning the light off, Jenkins pulled the curtain
closed. It was completely black inside.</p>

<p>"Have a nice trip," Jenkins said, pulling a switch on
the wall and pushing a button on the back of the chair
at the same time.</p>

<p>Currents shifted and repatterned themselves inside the
helmet and were fed into Allenby at the base of his skull,
at the medulla. The currents of alternating ions mixed
with the currents of his varied and random brain waves,
and the impulses of one became the impulses of the other.
Allenby jerked once with the initial shock and was then
still, his mind and body fused with the pulsating currents
of the chair.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Roger Allenby was almost blinded by bright,
naked light. Allenby's first impression was one of disappointment
at the failure of the device. Jenkins was
reliable, usually, and hadn't come up with a fluke yet.</p>

<p>Allenby got out of the chair and called for Jenkins,
holding on to the arm of the chair to keep his bearings.
"Hey! Where are you? Jenkins!" He tried to look around
him but the bright, intense light revealed nothing. He
swore to himself, extending his arms in front of him for
something to grasp. As he groped for a solid, the light
became more subdued and shifted from white into a light,
pleasant blue.</p>

<hr />

<p>Shapes and forms rearranged themselves in front of
him and gradually became distinguishable. He was in a
city, or on top of a city. A panoramic view was before
him and he saw the creations of human beings, obviously,
but a culture far removed from his. A slight path
of white began at his feet and expanded as it fell slightly,
ramplike, over and into the city. The buildings were
whiter than the gate of false dreams that Penelope sung
of and the streets and avenues were blue, not gray. The
people wore white and milled about in the streets below
him. They shouted as one; their voices were not cries
but songs and they sang his name.</p>

<p>He started walking on the white strip. It was flexible
and supported his weight easily. Then he was running,
finding his breath coming in sharp gasps and he was
among the crowds. They smiled at him as he passed by
and held out their hands to him. Their faces shone with
a brilliance of awareness and he knew that they loved
him. Troubled, frightened, he kept running, blindly, and,
abruptly, there were no people, no buildings.</p>

<p>He was walking now, at the left side of a modern super-highway,
against the traffic. Autos sped by him, too
quickly for him to determine the year of model. Across
the divider the traffic was heavier, autos speeding crazily
ahead in the direction he was walking; none stopped. He
halted for a moment and looked around him. There was
nothing on the sides of the road: no people, no fields, no
farms, no cities, no blackness. There was nothing. But
far ahead there was green etched around the horizon as
the road dipped and the cars sped over it. He walked
more quickly, catching his breath, and came closer and
closer to the green.</p>

<p>Allenby stopped momentarily and turned around, looking
at the highway that was behind him. It was gone.
Only bleak, black and gray hills of rock and rubble were
there, no cars, no life. He shuddered and continued on
toward the end of the highway. The green blended in
with the blue of the sky now. Closer he came, until just
over the next rise in the road the green was bright. Not
knowing or caring why, he was filled with expectation
and he ran again and was in the meadow.</p>

<p>All around him were the greens of the grasses and
leaves and the yellows and blues of the field flowers. It
was warm, a spring day, with none of the discomfort of
summer heat. Jubilant, Roger spun around in circles, inhaling
the fragrance of the field, listening to the hum of
insect life stirring back to awareness after a season of
inactivity. Then he was running and tumbling, barefoot,
his shirt open, feeling the soft grass give way underfoot
and the soil was good and rich beneath him.</p>

<p>He saw a stream ahead, with clear water melodiously
flowing by him. He went to it and drank, the cold, good
water quenching all his thirst, clearing all the stickiness
of his throat and mind. He dashed the water on his face
and was happy and felt the coolness of it as the breeze
picked up and swept his hair over his forehead. With a
shake of his head he tossed it back in place and ran
again, feeling the air rush into his lungs with coolness
and vibrance unknown since adolescence. No nicotine
spasms choked him and the air was refreshing.</p>

<p>Then up the hill he sped, pushing hard, as the marigolds
and dandelions parted before him. At the top he
stopped and looked and smiled ecstatically as he saw the
green rolling land and the stream, curving around from
behind the house, his house, the oaks forming a secret
lair behind it, and he felt the youth of the world in his
lungs and under his feet. He heard the voice calling from
that house, his house, calling him to Saturday lunch.</p>

<p>"I'm coming!" he cried happily and was tumbling
down the hill, rolling over and over, the hill and ground
and sky blending blues and greens and nothing had perspective.
The world was spinning and everything was
black again. He shook his head to clear the dizziness.</p>

<hr />

<p>"Well?" Jenkins said. "How was it?"</p>

<p>Allenby looked up at him as Jenkins swung the helmet
back and unhooked the seatbelt. He squinted as Jenkins
flipped the light switch and the brightness hit him.</p>

<p>His surroundings became distinguishable again very
slowly and he knew he was back in the room. "Where was
I?" he asked.</p>

<p>Jenkins shrugged. "I don't know. It was all yours. You
went wherever you wanted to go, wherever home is."
Jenkins smiled down at him. "Did you visit more than
one place?" he asked. The buyer nodded. "I thought so.
It seems that a person tries a few before finally deciding
where to go."</p>

<p>The buyer stood up and stretched. "Could I please see
the barn?" he asked, meaning the huge workshop where
Jenkins did the construction work.</p>

<p>"Sure," Jenkins said and opened the door opposite the
red curtain into the workshop. It was empty.</p>

<p>"You mean it was all up here? I didn't move at all?"
He tapped his cranium with his index finger.</p>

<p>"That's right," Jenkins said anxiously. "Do you want
it or not?"</p>

<p>Allenby stood looking into the empty room. "Yes ...
yes, of course," he said. "How long did the whole thing
last?"</p>

<p>"About ten seconds," Jenkins said, looking at his
watch. "It seems much longer to the traveler. I'm not
sure, but I think the imagined time varies with each
person. It's always around ten seconds of actual time,
though, so you can make a lot of money on it, even if
you only have one machine."</p>

<p>"Money?" Allenby said. "Money, yes, of course." He
took a checkbook from his inside pocket and hurriedly
wrote a check for six thousand dollars. "When can we
have it delivered?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You want it shipped the usual way?"</p>

<p>"No," Allenby said, staring at the red-cushioned chair.
"Send it air freight. Then bill us for the expense."</p>

<p>"Whatever you say," Jenkins said, smiling, taking the
check. "You'll have it by the first of the week, probably.
I'll put a complete parts and assembly manual inside the
crate."</p>

<p>"Good, good. But maybe I should test it again, you
know. Star-Time can't really afford to make a mistake
as expensive as this."</p>

<p>"No," Jenkins said quickly. Then, "I'll guarantee it, of
course. If it doesn't work out, I'll give you a full refund.
But don't try it again, today. Don't let anyone have it
more than once in one day. Stamp them on the hand or
something when they take the trip."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>Jenkins looked troubled. "I'm not sure, but people
might not want to come back. Too many times in a row
and they might be able to stay there ... in their minds
of course."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course. Well, it's been a pleasure doing
business with you, Mr. Jenkins. I hope to see you again
soon." They walked back to Allenby's not-very-late model
car and shook hands. Allenby drove away.</p>

<p>On the way back to the hotel, and as he lay for a long
time in the bathtub, letting the warmness drift away
from the water, the thought ran over and over in his
mind. They might be able to stay there, Allenby said to
himself. They might be able to stay there. He smiled
warmly at a crack in the plaster as he thought of the
first of the week and the fragrant meadow.</p>
